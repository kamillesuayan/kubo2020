          <h2 class="mb-4 section-title">What is <strong>Montessori?</strong></h2>
          <p class="mb-5 lead">It is a method of education that was developed by Maria Montessori in 1897. Maria Montessori was the first Italian woman doctor in Italy. She focused on child psychology and pedagogy (Pedagogy refers more broadly to the theory and practice of education, and how this influences the growth of learners. Pedagogy, taken as an academic discipline, is the study of how knowledge and skills are exchanged in an educational context, and it considers the interactions that take place during learning). Using her scientific understanding and observation, Maria Montessori formulated materials that are auto educating.  Allowing the child to learn on their own and prepare them to academics.</p>

              <p>The prepared environment is essential in every Montessori classroom.  The areas of Practical Life, Sensorial, Cultural, Math and Language are defined learning space for each child.  All Montessori materials are designed to help the brain tap into its  scientific and mathematical potential.</p>

          <p>Ms. Mary has been a teacher since 1996, and was inspired into the profession during her college years while doing outreach programs tutoring less fortunate children in South East Asia.  She began her teaching career with Jean Piaget Approach with a focus on experiential activities and core curriculum. She felt that she needed more education to be able to learn the child’s specific needs as they discover  themselves and the world.  She went back to school and began her Masters in Special Education.  Eventually, she became a Special Education teacher to children with special needs.  She took her Montessori Teacher Training year 2000 (American Montessori Society 2002) in the Bay Area to be able help mainstream special children in a regular classroom set up.  She fell in love with the Montessori Philosophy and  made a conscious mission to be of service to all children and their families.  She continued her studies and completed more ECE and Administration units both from Canada College and Cal State Hayward.</p>
          <p>Ms. Mary opened her home to families of Foster City and San Mateo year 2006.  She continued serving more families and extended her classroom to 3 locations.  We have a Hillsdale location and now Redwood City.</p>
          <p>She has two boys of her own who are 13 and 9 years old.  Both were Montessori children themselves and attended Public Montessori schools. Her husband is a Chief Software Architect and Senior Director of Visa’s Machine Learning and AI platform. He holds a Masters in Biomedical Informatics from Stanford University.  They work together on ensuring that the curriculum stays current and reflects the needs of the rapidly changing industry of Silicon Valley, while preserving the principles of Montessori - independent and self-directed education. As a family, they love making music.  Mr. Ron plays the guitar, Ms. Mary sings, Matthew plays violin and Mark plays the piano serving their ministry every other Sunday Service.</p>
          <p>In June 2019, Ms. Mary received her credential with Association Montessori Internationale (AMI) for Montessori for the Elderly.</p>
