                    Education. During her time in college, she learned about the Montessori Method and was instantly a
                    huge fan. She became extremely passionate about the teaching approach. She worked as a teacher at
                    Outschool for a few years where she did more traditional teaching but over time realized that her
                    interest in learning and practicing the Montessori Method is something she wants to pursue. Working
                    and teaching at Roots N Wings Montessori was a wonderful opportunity to start her teaching career.
                    She is currently taking her Montesori certificate at MTEC/San Francisco Bay Area and taking each day
                    as a one big step of becoming a true Montessori guide.</p>

                <p>
                    Aileen is a passionate educator at Roots N Wings Montessori School, holding an Early Childhood Montessori
                    teacher credential from the American Montessori Society.
                    She has a Bachelor of Science in Economics with a Minor in Math and Statistics,
                    which enhances her ability to create a structured and engaging learning environment.
                    Her love for teaching began early—she started tutoring children during high school and continues
                    to be inspired by working with young learners.
                    Writing is another passion, allowing her to creatively express ideas and explore educational concepts.
                    Aileen is committed to understanding each child’s individual needs and fostering a nurturing
                    environment where they can thrive academically and emotionally.
