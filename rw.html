                    Education. During her time in college, she learned about the Montessori Method and was instantly a
                    huge fan. She became extremely passionate about the teaching approach. She worked as a teacher at
                    Outschool for a few years where she did more traditional teaching but over time realized that her
                    interest in learning and practicing the Montessori Method is something she wants to pursue. Working
                    and teaching at Roots N Wings Montessori was a wonderful opportunity to start her teaching career.
                    She is currently taking her Montesori certificate at MTEC/San Francisco Bay Area and taking each day
                    as a one big step of becoming a true Montessori guide.</p>
