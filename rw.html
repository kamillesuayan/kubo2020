          <p>
            Roots N Wings Montessori in Redwood City is a 2 classroom child care center tucked away and surrounded by nature. Child to teacher ratio is 7:1. Our teachers are all Montessori trained and have years of teaching experience. We have 1 classroom that can take 3-4 kids who are not fully potty trained as we have a credentialed Infant toddler teacher. We have mixed age group classes for both classrooms. Having an older child in class builds confidence and responsibility. The younger child emulates the older child helping each other learn, discover and challenge themselves with the prepared Montessori materials.
          </p>
          <p>
            We have a monthly newsletter which includes our curriculum and topics in class.  Parents are most welcome to participate in our school activities and lead short presentations of any topic they prepare with their child.  
            We acknowledge that childhood memories are very important and we desire only to fill it with learning, respect, love,happiness and laughter.  Looking forward to celebrations like MLK Day, Valentine’s Day,St. Patrick's Day, Easter egg hunt, Earth Day, May flower celebrations, Summer Solstice, 4th of July, National Ice cream Sandwich day, International Literacy Day, Halloween, Thanksgiving and of course December Holidays. 
            We value the Montessori community and our goal is to be an extension of your family to find ways to reach your child’s full potential.  Together we can be all guides in supporting and empowering each child to become the best version of themselves.
